# Shop-Trends-AI

# Overview
This repository contains code for an AI-powered e-commerce product analysis agent. It integrates large language models (LLMs), real-time search tools, and a user-friendly interface to help users research digital products and trends—especially from marketplaces like Whop. The app delivers structured market insights in seconds.

# Abstract
The project leverages AI agents combined with web search capabilities to provide in-depth product insights, sentiment analysis, and competitor comparisons. By using real-time queries and summarization, it enables users to gain actionable knowledge about product popularity, customer perception, and market trends in the e-commerce domain.

# Introduction
The main goal of this project is to assist entrepreneurs, marketers, and researchers in discovering valuable product information by automating the data-gathering process using AI. The system can:

  - Search for trends, customer feedback, and reviews across web platforms.

  - Analyze sentiment and summarize pros, cons, and opportunities.

  - Present insights using clean formatting in a Streamlit UI.

  - Support custom product queries for tailored research.

# Problem Statement
Finding credible, real-time, and structured insights about niche digital products (e.g., SaaS, templates, courses) is difficult due to the dispersed nature of online information. This project bridges that gap by using AI agents to gather, summarize, and present product intelligence efficiently from across the web.
